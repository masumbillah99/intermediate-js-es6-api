/** An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, 
and tools for building software applications.

Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact.
Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI)
components.

I mean, API is the messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you 
want to do and then returns the response back to you.
